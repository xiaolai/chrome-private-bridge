# Codex Toolkit Configuration

Project-specific settings for codex-toolkit commands.
Generated by `/init`. Edit freely — all fields are optional.

## Project

- **Stack**: TypeScript, Bun, Chrome Extension API
- **Test command**: bun test
- **Source directories**: relay/, client/, extension/, native-host/

## Defaults

These override the built-in defaults for all commands in this project.
Remove a line to fall back to the built-in default.

- **Default model**: gpt-5.3-codex
- **Default effort**: high
- **Default audit type**: mini
- **Default sandbox**: workspace-write

## Audit Focus

quality-first

Additional instructions appended to every audit's developer-instructions:

```text
Prioritize code quality findings. Flag untested critical paths, high cyclomatic complexity, and DRY violations as High regardless of other severity heuristics.
```

## Skip Patterns

Files and directories to always skip during audits (glob patterns):

```text
node_modules/
dist/
build/
coverage/
*.min.js
*.bundle.js
*.lock
vendor/
.git/
```

## Project-Specific Instructions

Custom instructions appended to Codex's developer-instructions for every command.
Use this to tell Codex about your project's conventions, architecture, or constraints.

```text
This is a TypeScript/Bun project implementing a browser automation bridge (Client → Relay → Extension → Native Host). The relay server uses Bun.serve with WebSocket support. The extension is a Chrome MV3 extension. Follow existing patterns in relay/ for server-side code. Tests use bun:test and live in __tests__/ directories adjacent to their source.
```
